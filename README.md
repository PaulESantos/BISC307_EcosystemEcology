# BISC307_EcosystemEcology
This repository contains the lab materials for an upper-level (juniors/seniors) undergraduate Ecosystem Ecology with Lab course taught at Wellesley College by Jackie Matthes. This course is cross-listed in Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies. Computer lab exercises in this course focus on mastering data science concepts from the R 'tidyverse' set of packages and are designed for students with no prior coding experience. Labs are spread over two weeks, so that most labs have an "A" section completed in week 1, and a "B" section for week 2.
