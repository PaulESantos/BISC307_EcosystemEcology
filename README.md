# Lab Exercises for BISC/ES 307: Ecosystem Ecology at Wellesley College
This repository contains the lab materials for an upper-level (juniors/seniors) undergraduate Ecosystem Ecology with Lab course taught at Wellesley College by Jackie Matthes. This course is cross-listed in Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies. Computer lab exercises in this course focus on mastering data science concepts from the R 'tidyverse' set of packages and creating reproducible data workflows. The exercises are designed for students with no prior coding experience. Each lab topic is spread over two weeks, so that most labs have an "A" section completed in week 1, and a "B" section for week 2. The formatted instructions for each lab are in the html file within each lab folder.  

Before each lab meeting, students complete a Pre-Lab homework exercise (graded credit/no-credit) from the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) to introduce some concepts before class. After each pair of labs, students write a Lab Report in the format of a short scientific paper (Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion & Conclusions) and also submit their code to be graded.
